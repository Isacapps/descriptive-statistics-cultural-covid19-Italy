# Statistical Analysis of Changes in Cultural Participation in Italy Between 2019 and 2020 due to COVID-19 

## Project Overview
This project presents a descriptive statistical analysis of how participation in out-of-home cultural and entertainment activities varied in Italy between 2019 and 2020. The analysis is based on microdata from ISTAT’s Aspetti della Vita Quotidiana (Aspects of Daily Life) surveys and focuses on self-reported attendance at activities such as cinema, theatre, concerts, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites.
The objective is not to estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather to observe and compare patterns and trends in cultural participation across the two years. The analysis explores how these patterns differ by geographical area (North, Centre, South, Islands) and by demographic variables such as gender, age, and education level.
The project was developed using the R programming language and relies entirely on descriptive statistics and data visualisations to provide an overview of how cultural habits changed between 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (during the pandemic).

## Objectives
- Observe how participation in cultural activities changed between 2019 and 2020
- Compare participation rates by activity type (e.g., cinema, concerts)
- Examine the impact of socio-demographic factors (gender, age, education level)
- Assess geographical differences (North, Centre, South and Islands)
- Highlight the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cultural habits in Italy

## Scope of Application
- Geographical area: Italy (macro-areas: North, Centre, South, Islands)
- Time frame: Years 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (first pandemic year)
- Data type: Microdata on self-reported cultural activity participation
